# Folder_Synchronization
This Python program syncs a source folder with a replica folder, ensuring the replica is an exact copy. It handles file copying, updates, and deletions based on content changes (using MD5 hashes). The process runs periodically, logging all operations to both a file and the console, ensuring efficient, one-way folder synchronization.
